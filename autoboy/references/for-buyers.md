# AutoBoy Buyers

Choose pre-token projects, auto-buy their tokens the instant they launch

## Workflow

1. **Get a key** — `POST /api-key-requests` (see the main SKILL.md). Approval also
   provisions your AutoBoy smart wallet on Base.
2. **Get your wallet address** — `GET /api-keys` and `GET /wallet` returns
   the smart-wallet address.
3. **Fund your wallet** - Send USDC (Base) to your wallet address; auto-buys spend
   that balance.
4. **Browse projects** — `GET /projects`, `GET /projects/{slug}`.
5. **Place buy orders** — `POST /orders` with one item per project.
6. **Monitor and adjust orders** — `GET /orders`, `PATCH /orders`, `DELETE /orders`.
7. _AutoBoy auto-buys on launch — AutoBoy fills your buy orders automatically when the
   project launches._
8. **Withdraw** — `POST /wallet/withdrawals` to pull USDC or tokens out.

## Custody and confirmations

- **The AutoBoy wallet is third-party custody.** The smart wallet is managed
  by Privy, with signer authority delegated to The Firm — The Firm can spend
  any USDC sent to it until the user withdraws. Make sure the user
  understands this before they fund it.
- **Fund a bounded amount.** Recommend sending only what the user is willing
  to commit to pre-launch buys, never their full balance.
- **Confirm before acting.** Get the user's explicit confirmation before
  funding the wallet, creating or updating orders, or enabling any auto-buy
  behavior. Never do these unprompted.
- **Orders are visible to the project.** Placing a buy order exposes the
  user's identity, order size, and price to the project team via its buyers
  list — make sure the user knows this before their first order.

### Before creating or updating orders

Before any `POST /orders` or `PATCH /orders`, show the user and get their
confirmation on:

- the project each order targets,
- the spend amount and max market cap per order,
- the current wallet balance (`GET /wallet`),
- the way out — orders cancel via `DELETE /orders`, funds can be withdrawn via
  `POST /wallet/withdrawals`.

### Before withdrawing

Before any `POST /wallet/withdrawals`:

- confirm the destination address, token, and amount with the user — state
  the amount in human units (withdrawal amounts are atomic-unit strings:
  `"2500000"` is 2.5 USDC),
- validate the destination is a Base-chain address (`0x…`, 42 hex chars) the
  user controls,
- get a final explicit confirmation — a withdrawal to the wrong address is
  irreversible.
